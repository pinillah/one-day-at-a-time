# Explore The Universe, One Day At A Time
For this prototype I created 4 html files that have the content and workflow the user will be able to experience once javascript is added. 

index.html
  contains the main page + a form for users to submit a custom date
  I commented out the submit button so that I could add a link to another page
  styling was added to match the mockup

content.html
  this page is meant to showcase what the user will see after they submit a date
  they can click on the image to see if full size, navigate back to the homepage or go o favourites page

zoom.html
  is meant to mockup what the user sees after clicking the image

favourites.html
  contains a grid of images displaying the users favourite images
  since the project is meant to be a single page project, i removed the arrows so the grid will autopopulate and show extra rows as needed

script.js
  AI tool was used to generate the form so that users will only be able to select present dates up to 1995 (since thats when the NASA database ends)
  const variables and general functions were modified by me to suit the project to fit specific needs
