Title for the webpage: "explore the universe, one day at a time"

This website will be focusing on creating a modern and artistic interphase for the user to access and save images from the Astronomy Picture of the Day archive from NASA. 

Pg. 1 - Desktop Homepage:
    The user will be prompt to choose a date by selecting from 3 dropdown menus for day, month and year.
    Dates from the future will not be able to be selected. 
    The user will be able to submit the form by clicking "done". 
    On the bottom left corner, the user will see a star icon. When hovering the text "your cosmic collection" will appear, prompting them to click and access to a page where they can save and delete their favourite photos. (see pg. 4)

Pg. 2 - Desktop Image Page:
    The user will be presented with a page in which they will be able to see the photo of the day they selected in addition to the title, date and description. 
    On the top right, the user will see an icon of a star and a "+" sign, allowing them to add that image to their "cosmic collection"(see pg. 4). 
    The user can access their "cosmic collection" by clicking the star icon in the bottom right of the screen.
    Users can go back to the homepage using the "home" icon.

Pg. 3 - Desktop Image (high definition version)
    Upon clicking the photo, the user will be able to access the full size of the image.
    They can exit this screen by clicking the "X" at the top right.
    This will take them back to the Image Page (see pg. 2)

Pg. 4 - Desktop Favourites Page
    This page will display a grid of thumbnails of the images the user has added to their favourites.
    By clicking they will be redirected to the Image Page (see pg. 2).
    By hovering on each image they can delete that image from their collection.
    The user can use the left and right arrows to navigate through their images. 
    Users can go back to the homepage using the "home" icon.

Pg. 5 - Pg. 12 - Tablet + Phone sizes
    Minor layout changes were made to fit the different screen sizes accordingly while staying on brand.
